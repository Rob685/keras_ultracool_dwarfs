# Keras Ultra-Cool Dwarfs Classification Project
### Roberto A. Tejada Arevalo

Ultra-Cool Dwarf classification with Keras deep neural network. 
These Google Colab notebooks describe the process of obtaining our training sets. `smss_red_refset_reading.ipynb` builds the SMSS training set, and `DES_DERED_reading.ipynb` builds the DES trainingset. 
The `keras_workflow.ipynb` notebook contains our ML methodology, our models, and some results.
The `pred_analysis.ipynb` notebook contains our result analysis from the predictions obtained in `keras_workflow.ipynb`. So far, the data is too large to put into this GitHub repo and it remains in my personal Google Drive Folder, so the paths remain curated to their respective locations. I plan to release future tutorials in this kind of classification in this repo. At the beginning of each Colab notebook, there are bash commands to get the LaTeX fonts necessary to reproduce the plot fonts, but these are optional. At the beginning of `keras_workflo.ipynb`, I installed the necessary package to work with Hyperband, and this is required to reproduce the methodology of the notebook.
