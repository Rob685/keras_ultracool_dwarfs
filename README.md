# Keras Ultra-Cool Dwarfs Classification Project
Ultra-Cool Dwarf classification with Keras deep neural network. 
These Google Colab notebooks describe the process of obtaining our training sets. smss_red_refset_reading builds the SMSS training set, and DES_DERED_reading builds the DES trainingset. 
The keras_workflow notebook contains our ML methodology, our models, and some results.
The pred_analysis notebook contains our result analysis from the predictions obtained in keras_workflow.
